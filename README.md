# Optimized-Bubble-sort-in-best-case-N-Complexity
Optimized Bubble sort 
Actual Bubble sort compares the whole array n^2 times even if the array is sorted.
Optimized Implementation:
The above function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.

Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.

Sorting In Place: Yes

Stable: Yes
